# Big data - woods

## Project Requirements

- `pipenv`: Pipenv is a tool that provides all necessary means to create a virtual environment for your Python project. It automatically manages project packages through the Pipfile file as you install or uninstall packages.
- `environment variables`: For running the service there are few configurable options. First cd into ./service and add a .env file using the following vars:
  - `DATABASE_NAME`: Database name MongoDB (default: "woods_recognition")
  - `COLLECTION_NAME`: Collection name MongoDB (default: "dataset_cleaned")
  - `DATABASE_URL`: Mongo URI with db included (default: "mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017/woods_recognition?authSource=admin")
  - `TRAIN_SEQ_DENSE_MODEL`: Set "True" or "False" for training sequential dense model at start-up (default: "False")
  - `TRAIN_DENSE_MODEL`: Set "True" or "False" for training dense model at start-up (default: "False")
  - `API_URL`: API URL for swagger docs (default: http://localhost:5000)

## Install Pipenv

1. Run the following command to ensure you have pip installed in your system:

```
$ pip --version
```

You should expect to receive a system response indicating the pip version. If no pip is discovered, install it first. Alternatively, you can download and install Python from http://python.org.

2. Install pipenv by running the following command:

```
$ pip install --user pipenv
```

3. For your convenience, you might add the user baseâ€™s binary directory to your PATH environmental variable. If you skip this procedure, PyCharm will prompt you to specify the path to the pipenv executable when adding a pipenv environment.
