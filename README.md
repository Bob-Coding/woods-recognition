## Project Requirements

- `pipenv`: Pipenv is a tool that provides all necessary means to create a virtual environment for your Python project. It automatically manages project packages through the Pipfile file as you install or uninstall packages.

## Install Pipenv

1. Run the following command to ensure you have pip installed in your system:

```
$ pip --version
```

You should expect to receive a system response indicating the pip version. If no pip is discovered, install it first. Alternatively, you can download and install Python from http://python.org.

2. Install pipenv by running the following command:

```
$ pip install --user pipenv
```

3. For your convenience, you might add the user baseâ€™s binary directory to your PATH environmental variable. If you skip this procedure, PyCharm will prompt you to specify the path to the pipenv executable when adding a pipenv environment.

## Installing packages pipfile

To install all packages run:

```
$ pipenv install
```

Use environment:

```
$ pipenv shell
```
